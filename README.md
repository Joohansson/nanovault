# NanoVault

NanoVault is a fully client-side signing wallet for sending and receiving Nano.

## Discontinued

NanoVault is no longer actively maintained.

We recommend switching to the community-driven NanoVault fork **[Nault](https://github.com/Nault/Nault)**. Your funds are not stored inside NanoVault so the switch should be easy as long as you have the nano seed, key or backup file. If any problem, please check out [this migration guide](https://link.medium.com/CMNGXkqjj8).
